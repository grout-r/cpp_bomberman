How to Use
===============================================================
This lava textureset has a 'glow' map instead of using a texture layer 'added' to the diffuse to overbrighten it. The glow map can be adjusted in a photoediting application (brightness/intensity etc.).

The files can be used in one of two ways, either as an 'addon' pak or by including the assets within a particular project.

For addon paks make sure you add the pak checksum value to the addon.conf file so Quake 4 knows it should be using a 3rd party file/s.

For inclusive assets it's preferable to use both the TGA and DDS versions of the textures as this speeds load times up marginally (particulaly on larger maps). Simply drop the assets into your projects folder and change any file paths in the material file to reflect these changes.
